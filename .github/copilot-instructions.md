## Project Overview
This is a Vue 3 TypeScript project for a 3D hotel visualization application. The project uses:
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
- 3D capabilities for hotel visualization

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Use kebab-case for component names and props
- Prefer composables for reusable logic
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow Vue 3 style guide conventions

## 3D Development Guidelines
- Consider using Three.js or similar 3D libraries for 3D hotel visualization
- Implement responsive 3D scenes that work across devices
- Optimize 3D assets for web performance
- Use proper loading states for 3D content

## Component Structure
- Create reusable components in the `src/components` directory
- Use proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow atomic design principles where applicable
